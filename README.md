## Live template variables

If you are interested in adding extra functionality to your live templates, the (not yet comprehensive) collection of guides about the variable functions are available
in the [Template variable functions](template_variable_functions/) folder.

The documents in that folder summarize how functions available for Live Template variables work, provides examples and screenshots where feasible, and includes
descriptions from the official documentation.
